Many critics and figures in the British Media hyped the Arctic Monkeys and their rapid rise to acclaim through unconventional means and some even cited the Arctic Monkeys as revolutionising the way people find music as they built a fanbase on the basis of a few demos shared by fans through the internet. NME declared them Our Generations Most Important Band and Alex Turners lyrics and depiction of Sheffield and the night lives of teenagers in particular praised with him being labelled as a master of observation and USA Today claiming you probably wont hear better CD all year long and calling it utterly infectious. MusicOMH wrote that it was the sort of guitar rock that makes you fall in love with music all over again and along with many other critics cited A Certain Romance as the standout track and as being a wonderfully articulate dissection of youth culture that belies Turners tender years. It was however, noted that some of the tracks which had previously been released on the internet as demos had lost some of their quality and dont sound as good.', 6, 8);
